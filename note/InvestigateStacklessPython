InvestigateStacklessPython

It looks like stackless python is the way to go for MM.  I could either work on things
that are not affected by the scheduler or I could do some research into stackless and
build a telnet server with it.  I would prefer to try out the major parts together
as soon as possible before getting into MUD coding.   So this is probably a good time.

Stackless is awesome.   Stackless can be used as the scheduler for the game itself.  Each object will have a run method
that will get scheduled to run.

Each objects has a run method that blocks on its channel and waits for methods.   Special objects can override
the run method and do other things.    Also Each object implements waitForUpdate which allows stepped execution
of the code.  waitForUpdate will block the task until it receives an update message.  This allows for commands
to synchronize to the main clock(aka game.scheduler.Scheduler for now).
