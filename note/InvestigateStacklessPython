InvestigateStacklessPython

It looks like stackless python is the way to go for MM.  I could either work on things
that are not affected by the scheduler or I could do some research into stackless and
build a telnet server with it.  I would prefer to try out the major parts together
as soon as possible before getting into MUD coding.   So this is probably a good time.

Stackless is awesome.   Stackless can be used as the scheduler for the game itself.  Each object will have a run method
that will get scheduled to run.
