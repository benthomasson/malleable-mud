TelnetServer

Build a telnet server that allows users to connect to telnet interfaces.  The system would work by polling telnet connections for commands and
would return control to the main loop so other actions can execute.

Stackless allows for easy creation of network servers.   The server wakes up occasionally and checks for new connects or for new data
on the sockets.    It then passes execution back the stackless using stackless.schedule().
